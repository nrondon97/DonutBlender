Welcome to my Donut Practice in Blender project! This repository contains all the files and information related to my practice in creating a 3D donut using Blender, based on the popular tutorial by Blender Guru.

## Introduction
This project is a practice exercise in 3D modeling using Blender. The main objective was to create a realistic-looking donut, complete with frosting and sprinkles. This practice is based on Blender Guru's donut tutorial series, which is a great starting point for anyone new to Blender.

## Features
